# trancuong.me

Personal blog of **Tran Cuong** — a software engineer in Vietnam who writes mostly
Go, occasionally Rust, and builds tooling around coding agents.

Live site: <https://trancuong.me> · Source: <https://github.com/cuongtranba/trancuong.me>

The blog is where I think out loud about distributed systems, clean architecture,
developer tooling, and how coding agents fit into day-to-day engineering. Built on
the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme (Astro + TailwindCSS v4).

## What you'll find here

A few recent posts give the flavour:

- **Hexagonal Go: feature slices that test without a database** — a Go layout that keeps domain logic transport-agnostic.
- **One streaming interface over Claude's SDK, a PTY, and Codex JSON-RPC** — funnelling three agent transports through one TS interface.
- **wtguard: a three-layer guard that keeps parallel agents off main** — Docker isolation + git-as-lock + a commit guard.
- **Running coding agents in parallel without babysitting them** — multi-window layout and push notifications.
- **Resume the right Claude Code session by typing `claude` in zsh** — a small, dependency-free zsh plugin.

The full, always-current list lives in the feeds below.

## For LLMs & agents

This site is built to be read by machines as well as people:

- **`/llms.txt`** — an [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) overview: every published
  post as `- [title](url): description`, so an agent can fetch any entry in full.
  Generated at [`src/pages/llms.txt.ts`](src/pages/llms.txt.ts).
- **`/robots.txt`** — declares [Content Signals](https://contentsignals.org/)
  (`search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=yes`): content here may be indexed, used as
  AI input, and used for training. Generated at [`src/pages/robots.txt.ts`](src/pages/robots.txt.ts).
- **`/rss.xml`** — standard RSS feed.
- **Sitemap** — `sitemap-index.xml`.
